# K-means-Clustering-with-Google-Colab
K-Means Clustering is one of the clustering algorithms that entered into the Unsupervised learning group used to group data into several groups with a partition system (Wanto, 2020). Unsupervised learningis a data mining algorithm to find patterns of all variables (attributes) that are the target/label/class not specified. The K-Means algorithm is a clustering technique distance-based which divides the data into clusters and this algorithm only works on numeric or numeric attributes.
